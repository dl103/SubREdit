SubREdit
========

Lightweight Sublime plugin used to edit remote files via SSH. It's aim is to eventually be an all-in-one plugin for your SFTP needs without a complicated setup server-side. However, at the moment it only supports a very rudimentary opening of files.

Dependencies
============
-Paramiko (https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko)

To Do
=====

-Plugin should be easier/more intuitive to use. Perhaps looking to integrate its interface into the sidebar and have users be able to manage files through that i.e. EGit.

-Figure out the whole installation process of cloning the repo and implementing it, including dependencies.

Of course, any help is appreciated for those of you that happen to stumble upon this repository. Feel free to contact me at david.le@duke.edu. Thanks!
